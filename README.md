# LeetCode
 My solutions to LeedCode problems,
it is not 100% LeetCode implementation,
I have modified it so it can run in the terminal.
To do so you just have to write "python filename.py"
where filename.py is the file you want to execute.
Once you execute it, you just have to enter the data.

If you see any error or something that can be optimized,
please tell me so we both can learn.

THANK YOU!
